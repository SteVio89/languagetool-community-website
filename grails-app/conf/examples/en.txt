Its Buffy the vampire slayer time.
Its really hard sometimes.
And its that they donâ€™t understand them.
Who know's where?
Its more like when we all run down the field with the person who has the ball.

They think its unfair of me.
Hey, it's curly in the morning but slowly straightens to get wavyish by the time its dry.
But its just that I can never do anything because of him.
And its more like sit there sniffling.
Until its dried a little, we have to use it.
Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.

That being sad, he is an idiot.
I don't how to call in English.
